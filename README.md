This is a public demo allowing developers to compare and contrast popular E-Commerce open source platforms. Any notes about setup problems are here:

```sh
  # VirtoCommerce -- Some undocumented class throws SemanticVersioning Error (Don't recommend)
  # SmartStore -- Works perfect out of the box!!
  # Ubmraco -- Works perfect out of the box!!  Will need to compile Umbraco.UI for client code)
  # 
  
```
