# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

```sh
  mkdir -p ~/ec/templates4
  mkdir -p ~/ec/templates4/build
  mkdir -p ~/ec/templates4/platforms
  mkdir -p ~/ec/templates4/modules

  cd ~/ec
  echo "{\"sdk\": { \"version\": \"$(dotnet -v)\", "rollForward": "latestFeature"    }  }" > global.json

```
