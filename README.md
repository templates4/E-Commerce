# Welcome to E-Commerce Templates

This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

```sh
  mkdir -p ~/ec/templates4
  mkdir -p ~/ec/templates4/build
  mkdir -p ~/ec/templates4/platforms
  mkdir -p ~/ec/templates4/modules

  cd ~/ec
  echo "{\"sdk\": { \"version\": \"$(dotnet --version)\", \"rollForward\": \"latestFeature\"    }  }" > global.json

```
